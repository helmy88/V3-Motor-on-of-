1. Requirements:
- Edu Somo V2 kit
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- USB cable for connecting the Edu Somo to your computer
- Motor (DC motor or servo motor) and appropriate motor driver (if required)

2. Installation:
- Connect the motor to the designated motor control pin on the Edu Somo V2 board.
- Connect the Edu Somo V2 board to your computer using the USB cable.
- Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided Arduino sketch (code) to the Edu Somo V2 board.

3. Usage:
- After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
- You will see the motor turning on and off in 4-second cycles.
- The Serial Monitor will display the status of the motor ("Motor ON" or "Motor OFF") in sync with the motor's operation.

4. Pin Configuration:
- Modify the `motorPin` variable in the Arduino sketch to match the pin you connected the motor to on the Edu Somo V2 board.

5. Troubleshooting:
- If the motor doesn't respond as expected, check the connections and ensure the motor is connected to the correct pin.
- Make sure you have selected the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
